# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection is a computer vision project that uses deep learning to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project is built using Python and OpenCV, and it uses a pre-trained deep learning model to perform the face mask detection.

# Installation
To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine, along with the following Python packages:

OpenCV
NumPy
TensorFlow
You can install these packages by running the following command:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow
# Usage
To run the face mask detection program, simply run the face_mask_detection.py script using the following command:

python face_mask_detection.py
This will launch the program and start the webcam feed. The program will detect faces in the webcam feed and draw a bounding box around each face. If a face is wearing a mask, the bounding box will be green, and if a face is not wearing a mask, the bounding box will be red.

# Dataset
Please note that the dataset used to train the face mask detection model is very large and cannot be uploaded to this GitHub repository. However, you can download the dataset from the following link:
